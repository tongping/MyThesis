%% This is a sample doctoral dissertation.  It shows the appropriate
%% structure for your dissertation.  It should handle most of the
%% strange requirements imposed by the Grad school; like the different
%% handling of titles of one/many appendices.  It will automatically
%% handle the linespacing changes.  The body default is double-spaced
%% (except when you use the singlespace or condensed options).  The
%% default for quotations is single-space, and the default for tabularmultithreaded programs
%% environments is also single-space.  
%%
%% This class adds the following commands and environments to the
%% report class, upon which it is based:
%% Commands
%% ------------
%% \degree{name}{abbrv} -- Sets the name and abbreviation for the degree.
%%                         These default to ``Doctor of Philosopy''
%%                         and ``Ph.D.'', respectively.
%% \copyrightyear{year} -- for the copyright page.
%% \bachelors{degree}{institution} -- for the abstract
%% \masters{degree}{institution}   --  "
%%     if you have other degrees you may use
%% \secondbachelors{degree}{institution}
%% \thirdbachelors{degree}{institution}
%% \secondmasters{degree}{institution}
%% \thirdmasters{degree}{institution}
%% \priordoctorate{degree}{institution}
%%
%% \committeechair{name}           -- for the signature page
%% or, if you have two co-chairs:
%% \cochairs{first name}{second name}
%%
%% \firstreader{name}              --  "
%% \secondreader{name}             --  "

%% \departmentname{name}           --  "
%%
%% \copyrightpage                  -- produces the copyright page
%% \signaturepage                  -- produces the signature page
%%
%% \frontmatter                    -- these are required in their various
%% \mainmatter                     -- appropriate locations
%% \backmatter                     --
%%
%% \unnumberedchapter[toc]{name}   -- like \chapter, except that it
%%                                    produces an unnumbered chapter;
%%                                    alternatively, like \chapter*,
%%                                    except that it lists the chapter
%%                                    in the table of contents.
%%
%% New environments:
%%   dedication  -- for the dedication
%%   abstract    -- for the abstract
%%
%% The thesis documentclass is built on top of the report document class.
%% It accepts all of the options that the report class accepts, plus the
%% following:
%%     doublespace -- the default, indicates double spacing as per U.Mass.
%%                    requirements.  You will need this when you do your
%%                    final copy.
%%     singlespace -- for earlier work, not acceptable to the Grad school
%%     condensed   -- for earlier work, not acceptable to the Grad school,
%%                    creates condensed versions of the frontmatter. 
%%                    Condensed implies singlespace.
%%     dissertation - the default, indicates that this document is a
%%                    dissertation.
%%     proposal    -- indicates that this document is a dissertation proposal,
%%                    rather than a dissertation.  This will only change the
%%                    wording on the title and signature pages.
%%     thesis      -- indicates that this document is a Master's thesis 
%%                    rather than a doctoral dissertation.  This also changes
%%                    the default for \degree to Master of Science, M.S.
%%     allowlisthypenation -- (the default), allows hyphenation of words in
%%                    the table of contents, the list of figures, and the list
%%                    of tables.  I believe that this is acceptable to the 
%%                    Graduate School.
%%     nolisthyphenation -- disallows hyphenation of words in the table of
%%                    contents and the list of figures and tables.  Use this 
%%                    option if the Grad School doesn't like your hyphenation.
%%     nicerdraft  -- relaxes some of the Grad School's rules for working with
%%                    drafts -- has no effect when doublespace is in effect
%%     nonicerdraft -- the default, leaves things in draft as they will be in
%%                     the final version
%% umthesis changes the default font size to 12pt, but you may specify 10pt or
%%   11pt in the options.

\begin{abstract}                % Abstract
The advent of multicore architecture has increased the demand for multithreaded programs. It is notoriously far more challenging to write parallel programs correctly and efficiently than sequential ones because of the wide range of concurrency errors and performance problems. 

In this thesis, I developed a series of runtime systems and tools to combat concurrency errors and performance problems of multithreaded programs.

The first system, \dthreads{}, automatically ensures determinism for unmodified C/C++ applications using the \pthreads{} library without requiring programmer intervention and hardware support. \dthreads{} greatly simplifies the understanding and debugging of multithreaded programs. \dthreads{} often matches or even exceeds the performance of standard thread libraries, making deterministic multithreading a practical alternative for the first time.

The second system attacks one notorious performance problem of multithreaded programs: false sharing. We provide the first accurate and precise detection tool,  \sheriffdetect{}, which can pinpoint the name of global variables or the allocation context of heap objects that involve in false sharing problems, without false positives.  However, rewriting a program to fix false sharing can be infeasible when source code is unavailable, or undesirable when padding objects can increase excessive memory consumption or further worsen runtime performance. To resolve this problem, we provide a runtime system, \SheriffProtect{}, to automatically boost the performance of programs with false sharing problems. 

The third system, \predator{}, improves the effectiveness of false sharing detection. It can detect one more type of false sharing: {\it read-write} false sharing. Also, it can even detect false sharing problems without occurrences, thus overcomes a shortcoming of all existing tools: they can only detect those observed false sharing problems. \Predator{} is the first tool to uncover false sharing problems of real applications.
